Repository for storage of email attachments to send larger files

## How To Access The Files

You should have received a link to this repository or to the relevant
subdirectory in this repository. The contents of one folder in the top level
directory are relevant for you, named similar to:
```
<YYMMDD>_<descriptive_text>/
```

### Download the `.zip` Files

Download all the `.zip` files in the relevant directory. `.zip` files with a
numbered extension belong together and can only be unzipped if all files have
been downloaded.

### Unzip the Files

If not installed already, download and install [7-zip][7-zip-download].
In the directory you downloaded the `.zip` files, right click them and choose
`7-zip` -> `Unpack`.
You will be prompted to enter the password, which is used to AES-256 encrypt the
`.zip` file. You should have received this password from me through email or
other communication channels.
When the password is correct, the contents should be unzipped to your local
disk.
